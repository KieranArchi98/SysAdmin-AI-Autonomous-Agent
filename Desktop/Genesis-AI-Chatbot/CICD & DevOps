1. GitHub Actions

What it is:

GitHub Actions is a CI/CD automation platform built directly into GitHub.

It lets you define workflows that automatically run when certain events happen, like code pushes, pull requests, or merges.

Why we are using it:

Automates repetitive tasks such as:

Building your frontend and backend images

Running tests

Linting and formatting code

Deploying to Kubernetes or a container registry

Ensures consistency and repeatability: every commit can go through the same process without manual intervention.

Eliminates human error in deployment pipelines.

How it fits into the roadmap:

Phase 4: Initial CI/CD setup

Phase 7–10: Integrates testing, linting, security scans, and container pushes

Phase 12+: Automates multi-stage deployments (staging → production)

Industry relevance:

Widely used in companies for automated builds and deployments

Shows employers you can create reliable pipelines and automation scripts

2. Docker

What it is:

Docker is a containerization platform. It packages your application and all its dependencies into a single container that can run anywhere.

A container is a lightweight, portable, isolated environment.

Why we are using it:

Ensures your backend (Python + dependencies) and frontend (Node.js + NPM + Vite/Next.js) run consistently across all environments.

Removes “it works on my machine” problems.

Makes deployment to cloud or Kubernetes simple because containers are portable.

How it fits into the roadmap:

Phase 1: Dockerize frontend and backend

Phase 2: Docker Compose orchestration for local development

Phase 8: CI/CD pipeline builds Docker images for deployment

Industry relevance:

Standard for modern application deployment

Almost every tech company uses containerization for microservices or full-stack apps

3. Docker Compose

What it is:

Docker Compose is a tool for running multi-container Docker applications.

You define services (frontend, backend, database, etc.) in a single YAML file with their dependencies and configurations.

Why we are using it:

Connects frontend and backend containers together locally

Handles networking automatically between services

Makes it easy to spin up the entire app with one command (docker-compose up)

How it fits into the roadmap:

Phase 2: Local development orchestration

Phase 3: Pass environment variables (API keys) into containers

Industry relevance:

Common for local development and testing

Companies use Docker Compose for developer productivity and multi-service testing

4. Kubernetes

What it is:

Kubernetes (K8s) is a container orchestration system.

It manages running, scaling, and networking containers in production.

Why we are using it:

In real-world projects, you rarely deploy raw Docker containers directly to production.

Kubernetes automates:

Deployment and scaling of containers

Service discovery between backend and frontend

Load balancing

Secrets & environment variable management

Makes the system production-ready and scalable.

How it fits into the roadmap:

Phase 5: Deploy frontend/backend locally on K8s

Phase 11–14: Optional monitoring, advanced deployment strategies (Blue/Green, Canary, Rolling Updates)

Industry relevance:

Standard in enterprise-grade deployments

Knowing Kubernetes demonstrates you can handle cloud-scale apps and DevOps pipelines

5. GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)

What it is:

A registry for storing Docker images hosted by GitHub.

Works seamlessly with GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

Why we are using it:

Allows you to push built Docker images automatically after CI/CD runs

Other environments (Kubernetes, staging, production) can pull the exact same image

Versioning images ensures reproducible deployments

How it fits into the roadmap:

Phase 8: Push Docker images after CI/CD builds

Industry relevance:

Most companies use private or public container registries (GHCR, Docker Hub, AWS ECR, GCP Artifact Registry)

Shows knowledge of real-world container distribution

6. Jest + React Testing Library (Frontend Testing)

What it is:

Jest is a JavaScript testing framework

React Testing Library focuses on testing React components as users would interact with them

Why we are using it:

Validates frontend logic and UI behavior

Ensures future changes don’t break existing functionality

Adds professionalism and maintainability to your project

How it fits into the roadmap:

Phase 7: Add automated frontend tests

Phase 4–10: Integrate into GitHub Actions to run automatically on every commit

Industry relevance:

Unit and integration testing is standard for frontend development pipelines

7. pytest (Backend Testing)

What it is:

Python testing framework

Supports unit, integration, and functional testing

Why we are using it:

Validates backend routes, services, and ChatGPT API interactions

Catch bugs before deployment

Supports coverage reporting, which is an industry standard metric

How it fits into the roadmap:

Phase 7: Backend testing

Phase 4–10: Integrate into GitHub Actions for automated testing

Industry relevance:

Shows employers you know professional backend testing practices

8. ESLint + Prettier (Code Quality)

What it is:

ESLint: Linter for JavaScript/TypeScript (finds code errors, enforces style)

Prettier: Automatic code formatter

Why we are using it:

Maintains consistent code style across the project

Helps catch errors early

CI/CD pipelines can fail if linting fails, enforcing quality automatically

How it fits into the roadmap:

Phase 9: Linting checks integrated into GitHub Actions

Industry relevance:

Standard in professional environments for maintainable and readable code

9. Trivy (Security Scanning)

What it is:

Scans Docker images for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations

Why we are using it:

Ensures containers are secure before deployment

Automates security checks in the CI/CD pipeline

How it fits into the roadmap:

Phase 10: Integrate into GitHub Actions after image build

Industry relevance:

Security scanning is essential in professional DevOps workflows

10. Prometheus + Grafana (Monitoring)

What it is:

Prometheus: Collects metrics from containers and applications

Grafana: Creates dashboards for visualization of metrics

Why we are using it:

Allows observability in production or local K8s cluster

Track app performance, detect failures, monitor resource usage

How it fits into the roadmap:

Phase 11: Optional monitoring setup in K8s

Showcases real-world monitoring capabilities

Industry relevance:

Monitoring and observability are expected skills in professional DevOps

11. Terraform (Optional Cloud IaC)

What it is:

Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) tool for provisioning cloud resources

Why we are using it:

Automates cluster creation (AWS EKS, Azure AKS, GCP GKE)

Ensures infrastructure is reproducible, versioned, and maintainable

How it fits into the roadmap:

Phase 15: Optional cloud deployment

Industry relevance:

IaC is highly valued in DevOps; Terraform is widely adopted

12. Helm (Optional Advanced Deployment)

What it is:

Package manager for Kubernetes

Manages complex deployments with templates and versioning

Why we are using it:

Simplifies deployment to multiple environments

Makes rollbacks and upgrades easier

How it fits into the roadmap:

Phase 13: Optional advanced deployment

Industry relevance:

Used in production for repeatable, versioned K8s deployments

13. Blue/Green, Canary, Rolling Updates (Optional Advanced)

What it is:

Deployment strategies to minimize downtime and mitigate risk

Why we are using it:

Shows ability to deploy safely at scale

Demonstrates professional deployment knowledge

How it fits into the roadmap:

Phase 14: Optional advanced deployment

Industry relevance:

Standard in professional Kubernetes environments for zero-downtime deployment










phase 7 prompt~

i want to use pytest to add some testing and validation to the backend for my ci/cd pipeline. you can see my overall devops architecture in @CICD & DevOps  but for now i want these tests added to the backend : 'Backend app starts correctly

A health-check endpoint (or simple API route)

Basic response structure' place these tests in a /tests folder. I then want you to add frontend tests using jest and react testing library. again, have these tests stored in the frontend /tests folder and for now create a test that validates chat input and checks if its rendering as intended. we should then be able to display coverage badges in the readme for credibility. the pipeline should now do this:

Checkout code

Install backend dependencies

Run backend tests

Install frontend dependencies

Run frontend tests

Only then build Docker images. please also create an update.md document to keep track of everything you do
